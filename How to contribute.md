In the `#wiki` channel, you can use these commands to contribute to the wiki (hosted on GitHub and viewable on the website):

**Add or overwrite an article:**

```
!add [filename].md [content]
```

⚠️ If the file already exists, this will **overwrite** it completely. It won’t append or merge—be careful.

**Attach an `.md` file directly:**

```
!add
```

Just upload the file. no need to type content. The bot will use the file’s name and content automatically.

**Delete an article:**

```
!delete [filename].md
```
