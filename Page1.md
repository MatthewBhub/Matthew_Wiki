🧠 Module 1: Prompting Fundamentals
🎯 TASK
Define what you want the AI to do.


"Summarise this research article in 3 bullet points."

📚 CONTEXT
Provide background or constraints.


"You are a PhD student summarising for a journal club."

🔁 REFERENCES
Give examples or desired output formats.


Example output:

- Key finding 1
    
- Key finding 2
    
- Key finding 3
    

✅ EVALUATE
Review the output for relevance, clarity, tone, accuracy.


"Did it capture the main points without fluff?"

🔧 ITERATE
Adjust the prompt based on the output.


1st try: "Summarize the article."  
→ Too vague  
2nd try: "Summarize in 3 bullet points for undergrads."  
→ Better tone & clarity

🔁 Prompt Iteration Techniques
1. 🔁 REVISIT
Re-add missing elements (task/context/persona).


Forgot to specify audience → add “for high school students.”

2. ✂️ SIMPLIFY
Break complex prompts into simpler sentences.


❌ "As a seasoned financial expert, provide a concise summary of Q4, ensuring inclusion of key metrics, market factors, and projections."  
✅ "You're a finance expert. Summarize Q4. Include key metrics. Mention market trends. Add next quarter projections."

3. 🔄 REFRAME
Change the way you ask (e.g., analogy, story, dialogue).


"Explain AI overfitting like a bedtime story."

4. 🧱 CONSTRAIN
Add word limits, formats, tone restrictions.


"Write in exactly 3 bullet points, no more than 10 words each."

🖼️ Multimodal Prompting
AI accepts text, images, video, audio, code.
Still apply the 5-step framework.


"You're a UX designer. Analyze this screenshot [image]. Suggest 3 UI improvements based on accessibility standards."

⚠️ Responsible Use
Don’t blindly trust outputs → fact-check
Avoid private/sensitive info
Use checklist for ethics (bias, inclusivity, safety)

"Does this job ad avoid gendered language?"  
→ Ask AI to check for biased phrasing.

🛠️ Module 2: Prompts for Everyday Work

"Write a professional email declining a meeting politely."

"Summarise this Zoom transcript in bullet points for a team update."

"Give 5 name ideas for a new productivity app targeting students."

"Make a table comparing free vs paid AI tools by features."

📊 Module 3: Data + Presentations

"Write a Google Sheets formula to count cells with dates in the past."

"What are the top 3 trends in this sales data [attach CSV]?"

"Generate slide titles and bullet points for a pitch on 'AI in education'."

🧠 Module 4: Creative & Expert Prompts
Prompt Chaining
Break down tasks into sequential prompts.


1. "Write 5 blog title ideas."
    
2. "Expand idea #3 into a full outline."
    
3. "Now draft the intro paragraph."
    

Chain of Thought (CoT)

"Explain your reasoning as you solve this math problem."

Tree of Thought (ToT)

"List 3 different approaches to improve app retention. Evaluate pros/cons for each."

Meta-Prompting

"Help me design a prompt to generate social media ideas for a travel brand."

👥 Agents
Give detailed role + rules so AI behaves as a specific character.


"You are a picky book editor.  
Your task: critique this short story for grammar, tone, and structure.  
Stop when all paragraphs are covered. Be blunt."

✅ Final Takeaway
Build prompts like structured instructions. Always refine.
Use frameworks: TCR-EI + RSR-C
Examples & constraints make a huge difference.
