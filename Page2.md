These shorts from _The Sims 4: Get Together_ are insanely cool. I wanted to break down how they work and see if I could recreate the look.

What grabs me most is the belts wrapping around the upper thighs—they add asymmetry and visual interest.

To figure out the belt placement, I modeled the shorts and wrap details in Blender.!

### Result & Reflection

I built a quick prototype. just one leg, since I only had two belts. Getting everything to hold its shape was way trickier than expected. My shorts don’t have built-in anchor points like the game version, and my belts are bulky with big buckles. That didn’t help. I also didn’t want to cut them to size, which probably held the look back.

## How to Improve the Look on the Next Try

- Use **lighter, thinner belts** for better drape and less bulk.
    
- Add **custom attachment points** (like loops or tabs) to the shorts to keep the belts in place.
    
- Use **belts cut to proper length**, or swap for fabric strips that look like belts but are easier to manage.
    
- Try **elastic or faux leather** materials for more flexibility and comfort.
